# AI Coding Assistant resources

A repository of resources that you can use with AI Coding Assistants. Rules files, Custom Agents for Kiro CLI, Agent Hooks and more.

It is a bit of a mess, but its stuff I use daily and find useful. I am sharing with the mindset that they might be useful to others, and that sharing is a way that others can see how folk like me are using AI coding assistants on a daily basis.

As this space slows down (wishful thinking!) then I will better curate this set of resources. Until then, use them as is.

Feel free to use these resources, and submit PRs with your own.
