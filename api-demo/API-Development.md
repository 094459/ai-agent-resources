When creating APIs MAKE SURE you follow:

- Use Flaggser library to generate OpenAPI docs
- Provide a UI to visualize APIs at /apidocs
- Use doc strings as specifications
- Use response models and versioned routes (e.g., /v1/).
- Generate a samle Terms of Service file and link
- Generate helpful error messages for API calls that go wrong
- Integrate API Key and other authorization mechanisms based on the application security design
